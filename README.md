Using Javascript and NodeJS with a focus on classes and subclasses, this project allows users to input information to create a simple HTML website which displays information about a team. 

Using `node index.js`, users are prompted in the command line for the names, IDs, emails, and other pieces of information about team managers, interns, and engineers. This information then creates an HTML page complete with links to GitHub profiles and email addresses.

In addition to Inquirer, Jest was used to create a simple set of tests to ensure that all class constructors and functions work properly.
